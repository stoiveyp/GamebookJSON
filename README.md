# GamebookJSON
Defining a way to store gamebooks in a JSON format, along with clients that use them

## Introduction
I loved "choose your own adventure" books as a child. The fun of finding out if you've made the right choice - keeping your thumb in the previous page just in case. I believe there is still a place for these stories, and for us to create our own, but I think there needs to be a common transferrable format to allow those stories to translate to the modern age. My attempt at this is GamebookJSON.

## Gamebook Format

The primary concern of GamebookJSON is to keep the format simple, allowing a complete story to be easily created and shared. The json format is such that common extensions can be easily added (look at Extensions section for any discussed and agreed on)  

The format is currently being defined, and so should be considered v0.1
