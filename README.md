# GamebookJSON
Defining a way to store gamebooks in a JSON format, along with clients that use them

## Introduction
I loved "choose your own adventure" books as a child. The fun of finding out if you've made the right choice - keeping your thumb in the previous page just in case. I believe there is still a place for these stories, and for us to create our own, but I think there needs to be a common transferrable format to allow those stories to translate to the modern age. My attempt at this is GamebookJSON.
